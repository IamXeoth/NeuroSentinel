## 🎯 Vision & Objectives

NeuroSentinel aims to revolutionize cybersecurity defense by creating the first **cognitive-aware security system** that understands human psychology and predicts manipulation attempts before they succeed.

### 🎪 **Our Ambitious Goals:**
- **Cognitive Modeling**: Simulate individual psychological vulnerabilities in real-time
- **Neuromorphic Computing**: Implement brain-inspired processing for human-like decision making
- **Predictive Defense**: Anticipate social engineering attacks before they occur
- **Explainable Security**: Provide neurologically-grounded explanations for security decisions
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improve through behavioral pattern recognition

### 🔬 **Research Questions We're Exploring:**
1. How can we model individual cognitive vulnerabilities computationally?
2. What neuromorphic architectures best simulate human decision-making under manipulation?
3. How can we predict susceptibility to social engineering attacks?
4. What makes security explanations cognitively compelling to humans?
5. How do we balance security effectiveness with user privacy?
